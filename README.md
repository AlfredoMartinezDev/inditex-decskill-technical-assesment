# Technical Assesment for Decskill and Inditex

It is a little Single Page Application to listen to podcasts from iTunes.

I've used React, React Query, React Router and TypeScript because they're part of the stack required for the job position.

npm run dev starts the app in development mode in the 5173 port. (http://localhost:5173/)

To run the application in production mode in your local:

npm run build to create a build of the application and then, npm run preview to launch the app in the 4173 port. (http://localhost:4173/)
